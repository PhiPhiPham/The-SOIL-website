# The Soil Website
This project was developed as a Full Stack Development initiative for SOIL, a conceptual company that operates as a premium organic food grocer with multiple locations across Melbourne. SOIL is dedicated to providing high-quality, organic fresh food to the community. This project was created by Phi Phi Pham, Ricardo Devia-Valenzuela, and Tariq Ahmed.

## Full stack structure
**Frontend Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
