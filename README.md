# The Soil Website
This project was created for the second assignment of COSC2758 Full Stack Developlment. This was created by Phi Phi Pham (s3969516), Ricardo Devia-Valenzuela (s3970787) and Tariq Ahmed (s3949296). This was created through using HTML, CSS, Javascript for the front end, Express.js for the API and mySQL for the database. To speak from the front end to the API, we used Axios, and to speak from the API to our database, we used sequelize. For password hashing, we used Argon.
